# Subtitle Fixer
Perform offsetting, linear correction, and/or cropping of subtitles easily and intuitively.

___NOTE:__ This project was a rough draft, and has since been migrated from nw.js and raw JavaScript to Electron and React. The new project can be found [here](https://github.com/jdboris/subtitle-fixer-react-electron)_
